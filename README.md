In AISec_Lab4(Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic with K-means clustering) we did k-means clustering on kddcup.data_10_percent file which doesnt has labels, thus k-means clustering is used for unsupervised clustering. importing necessary supporting docs is mandatory to run the program without which it may give an error.We also have to import pyspar and hadoop.
